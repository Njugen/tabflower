#Tabflower

Tabflower is a window and tab management addon for modern web browsers. It lets the user sort and group tabs together into individual groups, in order to launch them at any time or at a scheduled time.
The purpose is to help the user to be more consequential while using the web browser, be it for slacking off during freetime - or maintaining focus during work. Or just to keep things organized.

## Features

- Creating tab groups from currently open windows and tabs
- Creating tab groups from scratch
- Tab groups can be named, and can have descriptions. 
- Launching tab groups at click or at a scheduled time 
- Option to automatically close currently opened tabs and unresponsive tabs before launching tab groups

### Under consideration
- Calendar (for listing scheduled launches), or as a selector for launch schedules
- JSON file/or JSON text export and import (if the user change browser)
- Sync between computer


## Techniques

- HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
- Javascript and React
- JEST for testing
- Webextension API, for using built in browser features (More about it here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
